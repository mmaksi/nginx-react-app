## Production Grade Workflow:

### Development Phase

- Changes made on a `feature` branch and pushed to GitHub.
- Then a Pull Request is created to merge our changes into `main`.
- Development server is used to run the app in development mode on our local
  machines.

### Testing Phase

- Tests run in a CI server like Travis CI or GitHub Actions.
- Once tests pass, we move to the next phase. If they fail, developers redo
  their changes and open a new PR.

### Production Phase

- New code is merged into `main` to production
- NGINX is the production server responsible for serving the Vite React app.

## Tools of The Trade

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- AI-generated tests
- Default SPA React app generated by Vite
